# To-Do List Application
This project is a simple yet functional To-Do List application built using Next.js. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, helping them manage their daily activities efficiently. The application emphasizes clean and responsive design, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices.

## Automated Testing
As part of ensuring the quality and reliability of this application, I have implemented automated testing using Jest and React Testing Library.

### What is Automated Testing?
Automated testing is the process of using software tools to automatically verify that the code behaves as expected. Developers write tests to check the output and functionality of their code, not only to catch bugs but also to ensure that they have thoroughly considered how their code will be executed in various scenarios.

### Unit Testing
In this project, unit testing forms the backbone of my testing strategy. Unit tests are written to verify that individual components function correctly in isolation. These tests mimic user interactions and validate that each feature behaves as it should. This "shallow testing" approach ensures that the smallest parts of the program work as intended before they are integrated into the larger application.

I have utilized:

**Jest:** A JavaScript test runner that executes our tests, providing feedback on code correctness.<br/>
**React Testing Library:** A tool specifically designed for testing React components, enabling me to write tests that reflect real user interactions.
<br/><br/>By adhering to this testing methodology, I aim to deliver a robust and reliable application, minimizing the risk of bugs and enhancing the overall code quality.
